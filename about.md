Hello, web-world. This is supposed to be my blog.  

In the future, I want to make it suck less, but for now it will be generated with Jekyll due to my time lackage (personal laziness, procrastination, etc.)  

I am a little mess these days. This is what I represent in the last 2-3 (or even more?) months (I have suddenly deleted everything I've wrote here before, ugh, so I have to recover this):  

- planning a lot of new things, getting excited about them and leaving them hanging, getting sad about it;
- being constantly tired and done;
- feeling sad about being a bad person;
- not believing in myself;
- spending days in bed;
- unable to make simple decisions, never feeling right about them;
- feeling anxious about everything and never relaxed;

How can I fix it? Well, I've decided, that hosting a blog would make me feel better, haha.  
We'll see. I hope, I'll keep tracking progress here.
