I think, I'm getting how it works! Ok, this is great. I've spent a lot of time on trying to find out how to apply a Roboto Mono font and etc. And all I had to do was just to wait a little bit for changes to apply. Wow.  
I've finished my labs, created a blog (now I'll customize it a bit) and have no power left on anything else. I'll eat varenichki and go to sleep.
