Ok, this is great. I’ve spent a lot of time on trying to find out how to apply a Roboto Mono font and etc. And all I had to do was just to wait a little bit for changes to apply. Wow.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve finished my labs, created a blog (now I’ll customize it a bit) and have no power left on anything else. I’ll eat varenichki and go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I think, I’m getting how it works! Ok, this is great.

I have already added some introduction about reasons I have created this blog in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;about&lt;/code&gt; section and, actually, I don’t know what can I add here 🌚&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, maybe, I will just start writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I still feel tired and I am not sure that I will finish my article today, but it would be great just to send it tonight. I also have to finish some labs for tomorrow’s final. So, I will start working now. I’ll prepare first class homemade cappuccino ☕️ and I will enjoy it while working with article and labs 😌.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Hello!
