<p>Hello, web-world. This is supposed to be my blog.</p>

<p>In the future, I want to make it suck less, but for now it will be generated with Jekyll due to my time lackage (personal laziness, procrastination, etc.)</p>

<p>I am a little mess these days. This is what I represent in the last 2-3 (or even more?) months (I have suddenly deleted everything I’ve wrote here before, ugh, so I have to recover this):</p>

<ul>
  <li>planning a lot of new things, getting excited about them and leaving them hanging, getting sad about it;</li>
  <li>being constantly tired and done;</li>
  <li>feeling sad about being a bad person;</li>
  <li>not believing in myself;</li>
  <li>spending days in bed;</li>
  <li>unable to make simple decisions, never feeling right about them;</li>
  <li>feeling anxious about everything and never relaxed;</li>
</ul>

<p>How can I fix it? Well, I’ve decided, that hosting a blog would make me feel better, haha.<br />
We’ll see. I hope, I’ll keep tracking progress here.</p>
