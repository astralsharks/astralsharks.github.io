Hello.   

First of all, congrats on failing with another blog, you've made it! Hurrah!  

Secondly, it's a new year, 2019. Some people post old photos, because 2009 is an optimum - everybody more or less obtained some device that was capable of shooting photos. Will I do the same?  

And, finally, today was supposed to be the nice productive day, tomorrow is my last exam. I thought that I will finally study and wake up prepared, and what do we got here? It's almost 1AM. Well, at least I know where to take the answers from, but this shit is sick. I planned to read the book at least.  

But the thing that turned me upside down was that sociology incident. She refused to give me another try of taking the exam even though she said to me personally that she doesn't mind listening to (my effortless attempts) once again. But still, our secretary has received an email, in which it was stated that I am not worthy of her time being spent on ME specifically. What the fuck. Bye bye red diploma, hello some weird dark thoughts about crimes and joining deviant groups. . .
